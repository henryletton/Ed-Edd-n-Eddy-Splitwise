# Ed-Edd-n-Eddy-Splitwise
I've recently been learning the basics of Java, and wanted to do a first github repo with it.
What if the characters from the popular animated show "Ed, Edd n Eddy" needed to keep track of who paid for what and who is owned money.
This code simulates a basic version of splitwise (a tool that allows you to track group expenses).
This code is run as a CLI (command-line interface).
